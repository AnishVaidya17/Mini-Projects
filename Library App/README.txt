author name and ISBN number. The app allows you to add, delete and change the contents of the

The data is stored in sqlite3 databse, which is either automatically created after executing the program 
for the first time or you can download the file provided. This is a basic app for learning the basics 
of the Tkinter Library and other python features and functions.
